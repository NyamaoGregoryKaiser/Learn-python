# Lesson 2: Introduction to Matplotlib

## Overview
In this lesson, we dive into **Matplotlib**, a Python library for creating visual data representations. We'll explore how to plot basic graphs like line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots. Matplotlib is an excellent tool to turn data into visuals.

## Topics Covered
1. What Matplotlib is and why we use it
2. Basic plotting types:
   - Line Graphs
   - Bar Graphs
   - Scatter Plots
3. Adding colors and markers for visualization enhancement
4. Practice challenge to apply learned concepts

## Installation
To get started, install Matplotlib:
```bash
pip install matplotlib

```
## Learning Goals
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

            Understand and create basic plots using Matplotlib
            Customize plots with colors and markers
            Recognize when to use different plot types to represent data
