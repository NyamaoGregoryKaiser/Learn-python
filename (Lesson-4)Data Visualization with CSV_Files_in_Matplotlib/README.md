# Lesson 4: Data Visualization with CSV Files in Matplotlib

## Overview
In this lesson, we work with **CSV files** to create visualizations in Matplotlib. CSV files are commonly used to store tabular data. We'll use the pandas library to read CSV data and Matplotlib to visualize it in various forms.

## Topics Covered
1. Introduction to CSV files
2. Using pandas to load CSV data
3. Visualizations:
   - Line Graphs
   - Scatter Plots
   - Pie Charts
4. Practice challenge to reinforce CSV handling and plotting

## Installation
Install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib

```
## Learning Goals
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

Understand the structure of CSV files and load data into Python using pandas
Create line, scatter, and pie charts from CSV data using Matplotlib
Apply plotting techniques to different datasets
